Introduction
------------

_django-hstore_ is a niche library which integrates the link:http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/hstore.html[hstore]
extension of PostgreSQL into Django.

HStore brings the power of schemaless databases into PostgreSQL, giving us the
link:http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/07/03/hstore-vs-json/[advantage of flexibility and performance]
without renouncing to the robustness of SQL databases.

Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-hstore

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Postgis compatibility.
- Python3 support.
- Nice admin widgets.


Django Admin widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.django-hstore ships a nice admin widget that makes the field more user-friendly.

Grappelli Admin widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.If you use the awsome link:http://grappelliproject.com/[django-grappelli] there's an even nicer looking widget for you too!

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- PostgreSQL's implementation of hstore has no concept of type; it stores a
  mapping of string keys to string values. Values are stored as strings in the
  database regarding of their original type.
- Hstore extension is not automatically installed on use this package. You must install it manually.
- To run tests, hstore extension must be installed on template1 database.
- If `django.middleware.transaction.TransactionMiddleware` is enabled and the project is deployed
  through `uwsgi`, the first request to a view working with models featuring hstore fields will raise an exception;
  see link:https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22297[Django Ticket #22297] for more details on this issue.
  This issue is specific to Django 1.6 and below.

*Important Note:* the future version of HStore will bring types, nested structures and more advanced
features, for more info read link:https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/on-the-state-of-hstore[On the state of HStore]
by Engine Yard.


Project Maturity
----------------

_django-hstore_ is stable, widely used library with well defined deprecation policy.


Deprecation policy
------------------

At any momment of time, *django-hstore* developers will mantain support for three versions of django.

As example: The current stable release of django is 1.6, so django-hstore official supported versions are: 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6. When
django 1.7 is released, 1.4 version will become on unsupported django version.

User Guide
----------

This section covers all aspectes that user want know about _django-hstore_.

Install
~~~~~~~

This section covers a installing _django-hstore_ and its requirements.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3+
- Django 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 (experimental)
- Psycopg2 2.4.3+
- PostgreSQL 9.0+

Stable version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source, bash]
----
pip install django-hstore
----

Development version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source, bash]
----
opip install -e git+git://github.com/djangonauts/django-hstore#egg=django-hstore
----

Upgrade from older versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In *version 1.2.x* some internals have been changed in order to simplify usage and prevent errors.

Values are automatically converted to strings, fields costantly validate input and so on.

If you are upgrading from an older version ensure your application code works as expected.
If it doesn't you will either have to update your code or tie your application's requirement
to the older version of django-hstore (1.1.1).


Setup
~~~~~

Basic setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

First, add *django_hstore* to your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`:

[source, python]
----
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    "django_hstore",
    ...
)
----

Second, collect static files (needed for the admin widget) with:

[source, bash]
----
python manage.py collectstatic
----

Multiple database setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If for some reason you have to use django-hstore in a *multi-database setup* and
some of the database you are using don't have the hstore extension installed,
you can skip hstore registration by setting `HAS_HSTORE` to `False` in your
database config:

[source, python]
----
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'name',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'pass',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    },
    'other': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'other',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'pass',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
        'HAS_HSTORE': False,
    }
}
----

If you do that, then don't try to create `DictionaryField` in that database.

Be sure to check out link:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/db/multi-db/#allow_syncdb[allow_syncdb]
documentation.


Note to South users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you keep getting errors like There is no South database module 'south.db.None'
for your database., add the following to settings.py:

[source, python]
----
SOUTH_DATABASE_ADAPTERS = {'default': 'south.db.postgresql_psycopg2'}
----

Usage
~~~~~

The library provides three principal classes:

- `django_hstore.hstore.DictionaryField` +
  An ORM field which stores a mapping of string key/value pairs in an hstore
  column.
- `django_hstore.hstore.ReferencesField` +
  An ORM field which builds on DictionaryField to store a mapping of string
  keys to django object references, much like ForeignKey.
- `django_hstore.hstore.HStoreManager` +
  An ORM manager which provides much of the query functionality of the
  library.
- `django_hstore.hstore.HStoreGeoManager` +
  An additional ORM manager to provide Geodjango functionality as well.


Model setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

.Model definition is straightforward
[source, python]
----
from django.db import models
from django_hstore import hstore

class Something(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    data = hstore.DictionaryField()  # can pass attributes like null, blank, ecc.

    objects = hstore.HStoreManager()
    # IF YOU ARE USING POSTGIS:
    # objects = hstore.HStoreGeoManager()
----

.ReferenceField model field is also straightforward
[source,python]
----
class ReferenceContainer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    refs = hstore.ReferencesField()

    objects = hstore.HStoreManager()
----

Python API
~~~~~~~~~~

You then treat the `data` field as simply a dictionary of string pairs:

[source,python]
----
instance = Something.objects.create(name='something', data={'a': '1', 'b': '2'})
assert instance.data['a'] == '1'

empty = Something.objects.create(name='empty')
assert empty.data == {}

empty.data['a'] = '3'
empty.save()
assert Something.objects.get(name='empty').data['a'] == '3'
----

Booleans, integers, floats, lists and dictionaries will be converted to strings.
Lists, dictionaries and booleans are converted into JSON formatted strings, so
can be decoded if needed:

[source,python]
----
instance = Something.objects.create(name='something', data={'int': 1, 'bool': True})

instance.data['int'] == '1'
instance.data['bool'] == 'true'

import json
instance.data['dict'] = { 'list': ['a', False, 1] }
instance.data['dict'] == '{"list": ["a", false, 1]}'
json.loads(instance.data['dict']) == { 'list': ['a', False, 1] }
# => True
----

You can issue indexed queries against hstore fields:

[source,python]
----
# equivalence
Something.objects.filter(data={'a': '1', 'b': '2'})

# comparison (greater than, less than or equal to, ecc)
Something.objects.filter(data__gt={'a': '1'})
Something.objects.filter(data__gte={'a': '1'})
Something.objects.filter(data__lt={'a': '2'})
Something.objects.filter(data__lte={'a': '2'})

# subset by key/value mapping
Something.objects.filter(data__contains={'a': '1'})

# subset by list of some key values
Something.objects.filter(data__contains={'a': ['1', '2']})

# subset by list of keys
Something.objects.filter(data__contains=['a', 'b'])

# subset by single key
Something.objects.filter(data__contains=['a'])
----


You can still do classic django "contains" lookups as you would normally do for normal text
fields if you were looking for a particular string. In this case, the HSTORE field
will be converted to text and the lookup will be performed on all the keys and all the values:

[source, python]
----
Something.objects.create(data={ 'some_key': 'some crazy Value' })

# classic text lookup (look up for occurence of string in all the keys)
Something.objects.filter(data__contains='crazy')
Something.objects.filter(data__contains='some_key')
# classic case insensitive text looup
Something.objects.filter(data__icontains='value')
Something.objects.filter(data__icontains='SOME_KEY')
----


HSTORE manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also take advantage of some db-side functionality by using the manager:

[source, python]
----
# identify the keys present in an hstore field
>>> Something.objects.hkeys(id=instance.id, attr='data')
['a', 'b']

# peek at a a named value within an hstore field
>>> Something.objects.hpeek(id=instance.id, attr='data', key='a')
'1'

# do the same, after filter
>>> Something.objects.filter(id=instance.id).hpeek(attr='data', key='a')
'1'

# remove a key/value pair from an hstore field
>>> Something.objects.filter(name='something').hremove('data', 'b')

The hstore methods on manager pass all keyword arguments aside from `attr` and
`key` to `.filter()`.
----

ReferenceField Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*ReferenceField* is a field that allows to reference other database objects
without using a classic ManyToMany relationship.

Here's an example with the `ReferenceContainer` model defined in the *Model fields* section:

[source,python]
----
r = ReferenceContainer(name='test')
r.refs['another_object'] = AnotherModel.objects.get(slug='another-object')
r.refs['some_object'] = AnotherModel.objects.get(slug='some-object')
r.save()

r = ReferenceContainer.objects.get(name='test')
r.refs['another_object']
'<AnotherModel: AnotherModel object>'
r.refs['some_object']
'<AnotherModel: AnotherModel some_object>'
----

The database is queried only when references are accessed directly.
Once references have been retrieved they will be stored for any eventual subsequent access:

[source,python]
----
r = ReferenceContainer.objects.get(name='test')
# this won't query the database
r.refs
{ u'another_object': u'myapp.models.AnotherModel:1',
  u'some_object': u'myapp.models.AnotherModel:2' }

# this will query the database
r.refs['another_object']
'<AnotherModel: AnotherModel object>'

# retrieved reference is now visible also when calling the HStoreDict object:
r.refs
{ u'another_object': <AnotherModel: AnotherModel object>,
  u'some_object': u'myapp.models.AnotherModel:2' }
----

Developers Guide
----------------

This section covers everything that django-hstore developer / contributor want know.

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming one has the dependencies installed, and a *PostgreSQL 9.0+* server up and
running:

[source,bash]
----
python runtests.py
----

By default the tests run with the postgis backend.

If you want to run the tests with psycopg2 backend you can do:

[source,bash]
----
python runtests.py --settings=settings_psycopg
----

You might need to tweak the DB settings according to your DB configuration.

If you need to do so you can copy the file `local_settings.py.example` to `local_settings.py` and add
your database tweaks on it. `local_settings.py` will be automatically imported in `settings.py`.
The same applies for `local_settings_psycopg.py.example`, which will be imported in
`local_settings_psycopg.py`.

If after running this command you get an *error* saying:

[source, text]
----
type "hstore" does not exist
----

Try this:

[source, bash]
----
psql template1 -c 'create extension hstore;'
----
